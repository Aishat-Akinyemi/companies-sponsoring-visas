# Companies that provide Visa Sponsorships


The aim of the list is to gather data on companies that sponsor employees from other countries.

It's well known that bigger companies do this but there isn't a lot of data on smaller to medium sized companies, so the goal is to focus on those here.

To add a company, either [create an issue](https://github.com/shubheksha/companies-sponsoring-visas/issues/new) with the relevant details or send a PR adhering to the format specified and try to provide as much information as possible.
